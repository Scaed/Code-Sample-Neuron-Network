This is a code sample created from my PhD thesis project.
It defines the building blocks of a neural network: the nodes and the connections.
There are a few gradations of complexity supported, from simple nodes that simple output what they recieve to nodes that model the spiking behavior of neurons from several brain areas.
There are two types of connections, one that unidirectionally connects node to each other, and one that exerts influence on other connections.
There is also a file for testing, Misc_Testing.java which is separated in its own package.
There is a main function in Misc_Testing.java that demonstrates the various cappabilities of the framework.
This code was written using the eclipse IDE. Execute using "java -jar Code_Sample.jar".
